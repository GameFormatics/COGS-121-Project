 all right some gonna test this  audio recording use it as a sample for the webapp that we're creating  hopefully it turns out pretty well  I'm hoping that the audio is crisp it's clear and it's understandable for the API  using this audio script I'm hoping that I will be able to transcribe about  thirty to forty five seconds of audio if possible  I'm trying to  %HESITATION  get this working because recently it's only been working with ten to twenty seconds video clips sorry not video clips audio clips and so I'd really like to get that working if possible  and so hopefully this turns out well about  and twelve seconds the felon so make that tent now and so I'm just gonna keep on rambling until it gets to one minute and then I'm gonna stop it and then I'm going to  download it
