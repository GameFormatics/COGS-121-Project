 this is the time for women in comedy like I love like seen all these trailers come out for like oh that's a comedy about women is it exciting to be in this absolutely yeah I mean and that was a great thing to feel like you're part of this group of women in comedy you know because I don't come I don't have a comedy background specifically so this for me like always feels like kind of %HESITATION imposter syndrome of like do I really blog here but I'm really glad that this is like a weird turn my career is taken from like classical theater and to like being and all these great comedies I didn't realize that you didn't go in for comedy no not you really cool yeah I grew up like a total Shakespeare nerd knowing of it so yes I I loved theater I did check up I studied classical theater in college and so not only do they like not studied comedy or TJ it's like not even part of the conversation so I had to sort of learn as I went %HESITATION just stealing from people I worked with basically  do you think do you think comedy is harder than sort of a classical Shakespeare it's got its own specific skill set that you need to learn  and when you're going in without that and you're in the scene with people who have years of experience it's incredibly intimidating I was so nervous especially the first season of community because  everybody else  with so much funnier than me and I don't know how to be funny I don't know what made me funny I didn't know how to make the dialogue funny I don't know how to do a physical bat like was also intimidating for me but I just stole from all of them and so that seem to work you should definitely use sort of Shakespeare company in like  that does not go over so well in LA like any any kind of Shakespeare quote I could throw out would just be met with stony silence so I  save that for New York
