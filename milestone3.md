# Milestone 3

## Changes and Similarities
##### Our screenshots are slightly different from our prototypes because this version is a combination of those ideas (without any styling). We decided to make our home and profile pages as Screen #1 and #2. The only differences are that users can’t make (and therefore delete) a profile and that we didn’t really have a home page in our initial prototypes. We showed all the core functionality, but not the landing page. Overall, our app closely matches our prototypes.
