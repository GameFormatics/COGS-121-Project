# Milestone 6

## UI Improvements

Our UI, in terms of HTML and CSS is relatively the same as it was before. We made some minor changes to it, however, in order to improve on the user experience. One change we made, for example, was changing the text input box into a text area as to allow for larger text inputs to be read and scrolled through. Another change we made was to enlarge some of the text in our quiz, which we found to be quite small for laptop and desktop users. Other than that we made a few minor additions including a Google login button which we may utilize and implement in the future. Other than that the rest of our changes were made in regards to data visualization and displaying the data which we were receiving from the IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding API.

## User Action 1

Show percent score out of total
E.g.:
- all emotions get total score of 1.5
- sadness is 0.76 out of 1.5 = 0.5 -> 50%
- on pie chart, they show up as 50%
- now you know that the majority of the transcript was sad, instead 
  of trying to understand relevance scores
