# Storyboard 2
## A player is accussed of being toxic (mean/salty/rude in gamespeak) and sets out to prove his friend wrong. He uploads an audio recording of himself and a chat log of the game (either/or is fine) to our app. The app then processes the language with a natural language processing API and evaluates the player's toxicity level in comparison to the app's scale and to others.

# Prototype 1
## Based on Storyboard 1. User takes a quiz on what phrases the user thinks is toxic or just banter. The user first picks a game that they usually play. Based on their choices, the app gives a toxicity score and compares it to the user's perception of his or her toxic behavior.

# Prototype 2
## Based on Storyboard 2. The user first picks a game that the files will be coming from. User uploads an audio recording and/or chat log of a game. These files are run through an NLP API to test for emotions, which then evaluates the user for toxicity and shows the user's percentile of toxicity compared to others.
